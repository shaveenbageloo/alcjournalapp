# Project Title

Journaling Application

## Getting Started

Simply Fork my app and download to your Android Studio.

Once the app starts up, it will ask for a Google Login Account, simply select your Google Account or Create a new one.
Start adding in your Journals / Tasks by clicking on the Plus button on the top right hand side.
You can View and Edit at the same time but click on the VIEW button no each Journal entry that you have made.

Note that a Journal Entry is the same as a Task Entry hence the application uses both terminology.
